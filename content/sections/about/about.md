Founded by former PwC data science consultants, Anpai is a meeting productivity consultancy that combines analytics and productivity research.

Bad meeting planning has real financial consequences - German companies alone are estimated to have lost â‚¬64 billion in 2019 due to bad meetings. However, fixing this issue is not as easy as one might assume. Team meeting schedules represent a complex system with many dimensions: a temporal component, networks of participants, event details, each individual's productivity cycle, and many more.

To help teams unlock their full potential, we developed unique tools that combine data science and insights from social sciences research - all while engaging and upskilling the teams. <a href="mailto:info@anp.ai" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Get in touch with us to learn more.</u></a>
