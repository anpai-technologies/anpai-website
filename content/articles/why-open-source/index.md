## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Without open source, we wouldn't exist
At Anpai, we have always been huge open-source enthusiasts. In fact, it wouldn't have been possible to build any of our tools without open-source software. From Hadley Wickham's `tidyverse`  to Tianqi Chen & Carlos Guestrin's `XGBoost`, we've used them all at some point along the way. In the same spirit, we built upon existing tools and software to help advance the state of *meeting productivity analytics* (don't fret if you've never heard of this term before; we invented it). Now that we've built some tools that are preferable to what's currently out there in terms of performance and general capabilities, we deemed it necessary to also share our tools with everyone interested by open-sourcing everything step-by-step. Over the coming weeks (and months), we will gradually publish all of our code on GitHub and continue to add to it when we build new tools.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ We think our contributions are a value-add
While generally very humble, we love what we've built and are convinced that anyone working with calendar data deserves better. Better in terms of speed, better in terms of out-of-the-box capabilities, and better in terms of looks (we prefer pretty visuals). In addition, we ensured interoperability with other tools used by many (such as `dplyr`). For more details, [get in touch with us](mailto:inf@anp.ai) or hop on over to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/anpai-technologies) and take our tools for a spin yourself. 

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ We believe in the power of community
Of course, we aren't only driven by altruistic motives. We want to advance the state of meeting productivity analytics and believe that nothing beats the power of a purpose-driven and passionate community. If you have ideas about how to make meetings more productive or just want to connect with like-minded individuals, [feel free to join our Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/anpaitechnologies/shared_invite/zt-15zpxmumo-Tf7dTMq6Xnw7N9YMoroKiw).
